## Design choices:

I created a Users table which self-references for worker-manager relationship.
There is a Tasks table which contains the job codes and their descriptions The timesheets table references the user table for worker and manager.
The timesheet table contains columns for task1..task8 and hours1..hours8
This table is not exactly in 1 NF but I started off with this approach and ran out of time to normalize the table.
